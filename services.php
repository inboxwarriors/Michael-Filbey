          <h5>Plumbing</h5>
          <p>Plumbing covers a multitude of things and Michael is happy to help with all your needs. Whether you have leaky pipes and need an emergency plumber or need a new kitchen or bathroom plumbed in Michael can help. Most of our property maintenance jobs tend to be small plumbing work such as leaky taps or plumbing in a dishwasher or washing machine. However, some of the more unusual jobs include fitting water filter systems and patio hot tubs.</p>

<p>We like to do a job once and do it properly and that is why we recommend good quality parts and fittings. A well executed plumbing job should be good for many years and as most pipework is hidden behind walls, cupboards or under floors it is really important to make sure these jobs are finished properly and we promise that Michael Filbey Property Maintenance finish all jobs to the highest standard.</p>

          <h5>Painting and decorating</h5>
          <p>Michael can undertake all internal and external painting and decorating work. This is a very underrated offering which often home owners try and undertake themselves. However, a professional job here makes a really big difference to both how your property looks but also to how often you have to revisit a job. Michael takes time to prepare your job properly, the preparation of walls, woodwork and other surfaces means that the finish to the job will be long lasting and look great. </p>

<p>He can also line and hang wallpaper and once again his preparation work and finish mean that your home will be the envy of your street.</p>

          <h5>Electrics</h5>
          <p>Undertaking electrical work instills fear into the heart of most homeowners. Quite rightly we have a healthy fear of the power running through those wires. That is why you need a professional, whether it is to instal new or repair old lighting, change sockets or switches, add new sockets or even change unreachable lightbulbs. Michael can undertake the simplest of jobs through to much more complex installations.</p>

          <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/tiling.jpg" alt="Tiling and Water seals">
          <h5>Tiling and Water seals</h5>
          <p>Tiling is often used to protect surfaces against water damage, cracked tiles and broken water seals are often left untreated. They tend to only get treated when the timber around them starts to rot and then you have a much more expensive job on your hands. Michael can repair the cracked tiles and broken seals before this becomes a real problem.</p>
          <p>He is also able to tile and seal new bathrooms, kitchens and utilities or remove existing tiling, make good and replace. Changing your old tiles can make a tired room look fresh and rejuvenated.</p>

          <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/bathrooms.jpg" alt="Bathrooms">
          <h5>Bathrooms</h5>
          <p>The two rooms in the house that people immediately look at and judge your home on are the bathrooms and kitchen. Michael is able to remove your old bathroom furniture, remodel and replace. He is able to design and fit new bathrooms and wetrooms or create an ensuite in an existing room for that extra bit of luxury.</p>

          <p>He can also instal electric or mains fed showers, change taps and sanitary ware or create shower enclosures over the bath or freestanding.</p>
        </li>

          <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/kitchens.jpg" alt="Kitchens">
          <h5>Kitchens</h5>
          <p>The heart of any home Michael can either spruce up your existing kitchen by changing doors and drawer fronts. He can fit new sinks and taps, or ovens and hobs to give your kitchen a fresh look. He can plumb in washing machines, dishwashers or American style fridge freezers. He is also able to supply and fit new worktops. If you are looking to start again Michael can help you design, source and fit your dream kitchen.</p>

          <p>Michaels experience as a cabinet maker means he can also come up with bespoke solutions to your unique problems, it is always worth getting him in for a quote and a chat.</p>

          <h5>Flat pack furniture</h5>
          <p>We almost didn't include the flat pack furniture service on the website as it is something we usually only do for our existing clients, however, more and more people get fed up and angry trying to follow the ridiculous instructions that come with them. More and more people realise that their weekends are for enjoying themselves and not spend all day Saturday putting a desk together and finding the drawers don't fit.</p>

          <p>Outsource your flat pack build to a professional and Michael will do this in a cost effective, timely manner and most importantly you wont have to do it.</p>
