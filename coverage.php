          <h3>Coverage</h3>
          <p>Michael is based in Uxbridge and as a rule of thumb looks to work within a 20-30 minute driving distance of Uxbridge. This is primarily to give him flexibility to get to emergency call outs quickly should the need arise. Using Uxbridge as the centre point the preferred work areas are Slough and Beaconsfield in the West, Amersham in the North, Ealing in the East and Heathrow and Hounslow in the South.</p>

            Hours and call out
          </h3>
          <p>Michaels normal working hours are 08:00 to 17:00 and he likes to arrive early and get straight on with the job at hand. Should a job require Michael to arrive earlier or stay later then he is very flexible and happy to try and accommodate your needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>His emergency call out hours are Monday to Saturday 07:00 to 22:00 and emergency call out is likely to incur a small call out fee on top of the normal hourly rate, but call Michael to discuss.</p>
